# The Red Fort - Neha Kumari

## About Red Fort ##
The Red Fort, which is also known as the Lal Qila, was constructed by one of the most famous Mughal emperors, Shah Jahan.  
Built on the banks of river Yamuna, the fortress-palace was designed by architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. It took 8 years and 10 months to build the magnificent fort.  
The fort served as the royal residence of the Mughal emperors from 1648 to 1857. It took over the honor of royal residence from the famous Agra Fort when Shah Jahan decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
The Red Fort derives its name from the red-sandstone walls, which make the fort almost impregnable. The fort, which is located at Old Delhi, is one of the massive and prominent structures of India and is a fine example of Mughal architecture.  
It is often considered as the pinnacle of Mughal creativity. In modern times, the fort is of importance to the people of India as the Indian Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech from the fort, every year on August 15. In 2007, it was declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site.  
The Red Fort is the largest historical structure in Delhi. Every year, the Prime Minister of India hoists the tricolor flag on every Independence Day. Security around the fort during the Independence Day celebrations is tightened as the place was attacked by terrorists on 22 December in the year 2000.
