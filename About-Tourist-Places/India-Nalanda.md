## About Tourist Place 
Nalanda (Nālandā, pronounced [naːlən̪d̪aː]) was a renowned Buddhist monastic university in ancient Magadha (modern-day Bihar), India.[5][6] Considered by historians to be the world's very first residential university,[7] and among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world, it was located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kilometres (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna), operating from 427 to 1197 CE.[8][9] Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE, a period that has since been described as the "Golden Age of India" by scholars.[10]

Nalanda was established during the Gupta Empire era,[11] and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons – both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.[12][13] Over some 750 years, its faculty included some of the most revered scholars of Mahayana Buddhism.
