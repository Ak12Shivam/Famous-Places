# Name of Tourist Place - Your Name
Rishikesh-Neharaj
## About Tourist Place 
Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s, when the Beatles spent time in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashramâ€“now an abandoned site that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans.
The town is nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the holy Ganges River, and serves as a center for yoga and pilgrimages. Take part in the action, or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells and sightseeing from Rishikesh's two suspension bridges, often guarded by assertive families of monkeys. Keep your distance.
